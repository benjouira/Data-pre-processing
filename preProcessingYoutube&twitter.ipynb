(no joke, it literally did!)It's very easy to connect the plastic track/assemble, it takes 2 mins. It's very easy to connect the trains together and apply to track.All you need is two AA batteries and time to watch your child enjoy themselves!We even added homemade tunnels to this to make it more fun, we simply cut holes in cardboard boxes to put around certain parts of the track!This is brilliant for very young kids if they're very interested in trains. This gets them started in the hobby and doesn't cost much at all!\n",

If you have cats for example they are sure to damage the delicate parts as they seek to derail the train from the track.\n",

            "comment : I bought this Train set for my son and am a complete novice when it comes to Train sets.The Hornby set feels solid and attention is paid to the detail on the train. It comes with a mat, which is actually a giant printed poster. For the long term, a hard backing is needed.The track layout feels like it is the next size up from a basic layout as it already contains an extension pack.The train itself is not huge and looks silly pulling long  passenger carriages (as it would on a real train).It is quite expensive and had I not seen it at a reduced price, I probably would not have bought it (hence 4 / 5). The train can actually go quite fast in both directions. As novice I have discovered several features that must be well known to train set enthusiasts:The Trains can be tricky to get all wheels on the track. (I think there is an accessory to help with this)Big Long carriages do not like tight bends at speed (they come off).When using points to guide the train onto an inner circuit (I bought more track) you need to get jumper leads from Hornby and these are not included in Extension packs A & B.Without these the train loses power, but I think they are relatively cheap.The Track needs to be cleaned with a cloth, as any grease / dirt can stop the power to the trainTrain track has to be carefully aligned when joining one section to another, so continually putting it away and getting it out is time consuming - setting it up on a hard backing is a better solution.My child is very careful with the set and its contents, but not an ideal present for kids who leave it lying around and step on it (the carriages are expensive). I can see why people like train sets and this is a good introductory set with the plethora of accessories and trains etc from Hornby  and others we were left wanting to buy more bits and pieces (such as electric rather than manual points) after using this set.\n",

            "comment : Every child should own a train set, and lately I've started suspecting that every middle-aged man should have one too, so I ordered this so that  me and my little lad will have a shared interest. (And,  if he turns out to be more interested in video games and hoverboards and whatnot, that's OK too: I shall move the layout to my shed and drink homebrew alone, whilst building titchy windmills).It's nice to see, after not handling  a set since the early 70s, that Hornby still maintains that quality old-school feel, lots of detailed modelling and reassuring metal components. This starter set represents a small pre-war Welsh local service, with both passenger and freight carriages, but comes with a printed landscape mat which shows you how you might extend this into a more ambitious layout.It's very difficult to find anything to criticise about this set: I guess everyone knows that Hornby are the Dons of the model railway game, and the price is what it is: They've always been quite expensive toys. One issue might be that most larger layouts now are apparently controlled digitally, whereas this is on an old style analogue controller, which I guess means that if you decide to build up to a set with more trains, etc, this  set would have to run on a separate track?So, I'm really glad i own a trainset again, and am looking forward to spending my dotage buying tiny little tins of humbrol enamel in shades like GWR Olive Drab and staring into the windows of model shops wondering whether to invest in the  1/72 00/H0 Village Garage with Petrol Pump.\n",

            "comment : My son was purchased this train set for Christmas. My son is mad on trains and loves model train sets set up in shops, museums etc. I have never used a Hornby set before, but it is clearly well thought out, very detailed and is high quality. The first time I put it together I was surprised how fiddly it was, it certainly is not for a child to put together. The track was huge, but there is not an awful lot of variety to the set, it can be oval or circular and that's about it. It comes with a large poster of the ground that is ideal for aesthetics, but in the long term its best to be on some sort of hard backing - and here is where the issue with this is. It is such a great toy, very classic, but to put it on a board is so much more complicated than it appeared for a few reasons. 1. It's huge, to put it on a board you need a dedicated space where it could be on a table or put away in some sort of bespoke contraption. We have allocated space under a double bed for the board. A chunk of MDF this size is around £15-£20. 2. My second idea when I realised how much floor space it takes up I thought it may be better to go up a mountain for example, but to go up you need to slope very very gradually, otherwise it climbs a bit and slides back down. I put one side sloping up using a how to train your dragon book on each side and two at the end and it couldn't climb up the far end. 3. Once you accept its going to take up a loafs of space, and once you accept it won't slope upwards much you will naturally look to add variety to the track. We looked at having the large oval with two half circles on the inside by adding 3 3rd radius double curves in two places in the middle (total of 6), as well as one more left hand curve and straight and two right hand curve and straight pieces.Read more ›\n",

            "comment : I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and he loves it so much. I have also bought him others in the series. They are very strong toys due to being die cast and do take a lot of banging and bumping about during play, without damage to their paintwork.My grandson is obsessed with rescue scenarios at the moment and loves to bring Kevin in to help if James crashes. The fact that James talks too enthralls him. He get's so excited everytime he gets a new engine, as he wants to hear what it sounds like. He has to date..Thomas, Spencer, Percy, Diesel, Toby,and some other's. He has Bertie bus and a small Harold too.It's great they have magnets too which means all the engines can pull each other and their tender's. He likes to swap them all about and put them all together in a long line. This is one of the toys I've seen him having the most pleasure from so far. He plays contentedly for hours with these engines, making up his own scenarios.I have more of these put away for him, and have just given him Spencer which he again loved.One little comment, I wish it was made plain in Amazon's product details which ones talk and don't. Which are die cast etc, I find myself sometimes going through products for an age, or going to other sites, to make sure I have the right one.Sometimes a search for talking brings up non talking in the mix as well. Not a major point and not a dig at Amamzon as I use them constantly and I'm always pleased with the service, but it would make shopping for these quicker and easier. Brilliant toys all round, great fun and kids love them.\n",

            "comment : Although the review title is positive I do have to start off with a small compliant. Although the package arrived and appeared to be well protected for some reason the front 4 wheels/bogey area was not connected up to the rest of the train and it took a while to figure out how to fix it on properly!That said, I think this is most likely an unlucky one off. The train set is good value for money (especially when compared to the crazy prices for the DCC already installed trains!), the locomotive and carriages appear to be of a very good standard and it runs excellently so far. No regrets in buying this at all!EDIT - I now have to add another negative point... though it has a happy ending. After a day or so the locomotive stuttered and stopped. It had occurred to me while it was running that it sounded a little rough compared to what it should sound like but the stoppage was quite sudden... though it did get going again it was stuttering still. If you come across this apply some small amounts of machine oil to the areas mentioned in the maintenance guide that comes with this train set and then try and running it for a few minutes and it should return to normal!\n",

            "comment : This is one of the most popular trains in the world and Hornby has produced a very good model which looks like the real machine.Before I purchased this train set, I did some research and found that there are several versions of the Flying Scotsman train set.The versions are:-1) Flying Scotsman train set which includes two coaches, oval and track pack A.2) Flying Scotsman train set which includes three coaches, oval and track pack A.3) Flying Scotsman train set which includes three coaches, oval with track pack A and B.As I already have the Eurostar train set with Track packs A,B,C and D I decided to buy No.2. I have used most of the track to integrate it with my existing train set, and will extend it later when I buy some more points. That way I don't have any room for Track Packs E and F.The detail to the engine and the tender are very good and when it runs you can see the connecting rods moving. The three coaches are of good detail, you can see into the windows, each coach has 1st and 3rd class compartments (2nd class disappeard sometime ago) and both the corridor and seats are clearly visible.Putting the train on the track took a little time and care is needed when coupling it to the coal tender and the rest of the train.I found that the Flying Scotsman does require a very flat surface to run one, and time needs to be spent getting all the creases out the base mat.As this train set is at a cost, I would not let young children play with it on their own, but under adult supervision they should be able to enjoy this train set.Read more ›\n",

            "comment : Especially as discounted by Amazon, this is a good price for what is mostly an attractive and well made train set. I'd classify it as a younger-modeller or beginner's set in that the detailing isn't as fine as Hornby's more expensive models, or of some of the others in the market, e.g. Bachmann.The track is pretty good quality, but does need laying carefully on a hard and properly flat surface - I certainly wouldn't use the trackmat on the floor. Train sets like this really need a level of preparation and investment in a solid baseboard, and without one you'll run into problems like some of the other reviewers.The real problem I have is that the coupling on the rear of the tender that connects it to the carriages is ridiculously flimsy; it's held in place by a tiny thread of unsupported soft plastic; after about ten light uses of the set it's already nearly snapped off and can no longer support its own weight.I purchased this as a project to build with my young son and with memories of the Hornby set I had as a boy. It's really disappointing to find that it's many good qualities are ruined by a small but crucial element that renders it quickly useless.\n",

            "comment : Despite some negative reviews regarding the quality of the layout mat, we decided to take a chance and get this as a Christmas present for our 12-year old son. Surprisingly, the mat turned out to be made of vinyl and not paper as described (I guess that Hornby listens to its customers!). This on top of the high quality track, carriages and engine, it made the perfect gift. A little forward planning helped as we had a sheet of thin board ready to ensure a smooth surface for trouble-free track set-up. The bottom line is that our son is thrilled with the set and is currently shopping for track expansion sets to spend his Amazon gift vouchers on!\n",

I am now the proud owner of the Flying Scotsman from the famous Hornby and this particular (OLD) little boy is like a dog with two tails (at least). What a wonderful set, designed as a complete starter set with mat, track etc etc.This quality product is very possibly going to be the start of something big, very big.

Loki's horns keep falling off, which is very irritating.The Hulk and Loki are very different sizes, so their accessories aren't as interchangeable as some other Mashers.

Civilised and with everyone taking a turn, or more as the game suggests, shaking the dice and grabbing for the card you want so you can collect you card sets before anyone else. But be warned, if you pick up a card with a corresponding dice that chimes ... you can't have it. If you play the second version make sure you've got plenty of room and there are no breakables within the immediate area. Especially if over enthusiastic children are playing!  Really good fun.

In essence, you roll the dice try and match a letter on the dice to any one of the 9 face-up cards products and you win that card ... Almost!!  If you pick a dice with a bell then you don't win the card.  The aim is to collect 2 sets of coloured cards.  Simple to pick up.  Quite a small box so quite transportable.

            "comment : This is a great game for 2-4 players, comprising nine dice with a different letter on each face. A player rolls the dice and then has the opportunity to roll each dice again up to three times with the objective of making the highest scoring word. Each player takes a turn, and the scores are totted up. Play resumes back with the first player until a player reaches a pre-decided winning total.The way the scoring system works is quite clever too, in that there is a compromise between the length of the word and complexity of it, as each letter has a different score associated with it. To score the turn, the number of letters in the word is multiplied by the score of each of those letters (the tube includes a multiplication table to ease you through this).This is a rewarding game where the chance element is large enough to bridge gaps between different intelligence levels, but an enjoyable experience for all. I would recommend this as a family activity, or for out and about, as it takes up almost no space.\n",

I had thought about lettered dice also, but this guy just seems to have hit the nail on the head. It's very good.I was playing it last night and invented a patience version whereby you can actually play/challenge the dice.Basically you play as usual, but when it comes to the \"dice's turn\" you roll all 9 dice, then remove the vowels leaving just the consonants. You must remove at least 3 vowels. If you could only remove 2 max, then roll the remaining consonants again to produce more vowels to remove. The Dice similarly have 3 rolls max per turn but only if required. If after 1 or 2 rolls the minimum 3 vowels have been removed you then stop rolling. If after 3 rolls you have still only managed to remove 2 vowels max then that is just hard luck. You then add up the word value of the consonants as you would a real word, then multiply by how many consonants, again as you would a real word.? = vowel but Y does not.\n",

            "comment : Like many of the best ideas, Dicewords is very simple and the rules can be learned in a couple of minutes.  It has elements of Scrabble and Boggle (and no doubt other word games) but at the same time has its own unique character. It's extremely flexible: it can be played anywhere, with any number of people, for any length of time, and with any level of skill. It can be enjoyed by everyone - from the 6-year-old who can spell a couple of dozen words to the hardened Scrabble fanatic. However, what I personally enjoy most about it is the collaborative element. While Scrabble tends to generate long silences as players struggle with impossible letter combinations, and Boggle creates frantic mayhem while everyone races each other to get the most words, Dicewords invariably seems to encourage co-operation between players. Although each player has their own turn with their own letters, everyone else can watch them put a word together and this often ends up as a group activity. Most of my best words have been made with other people's letters! This does, of course, mean that winning the game is a rather random affair, but it's a great deal more fun than sitting silently for an hour or so. For this reason, it works well as a party game and is a great icebreaker if you have friends who don't know each other well. Of course, it can also be played in a deadly serious and competitive fashion, if that's what you want. Anyone who enjoys word games will love this, and I can imagine it would work very well in an educational environment too.\n",

I love my copy of Race' and will be keeping it, but Roll For The Galaxy doesn't have the same massive barrier to entry, and can be taught to new payers in half the time.One or two of the tiles and have overly complex or unclear scoring systems, but generally things are well laid out, with rules written directly on the tiles instead of the cryptic iconography of Race'. Everyone has picked this up fully by the end of their first game, and been eager to immediately play a second.\n",

You get 9 cubes and the idea is to write a story using the pictures as they fall. I often only use 3 dice and write a really short 300-500 word story or a bit of prose. Extend your imagination by taking 1 dice and when the picture comes up do not take it at face value. Write down all the things the picture COULD represent, not just the obvious, e.g. the lightning cube could be lightning, speach bubble, ghost, fir tree etc etc. Let your mind wander.\n",

The new Jango Fett mini figure is nice to see in a pack at this price and the track pieces add a good level of detail to the model.My 7 year old loves it as it allows him to pitch his clones with their speeders and cannons against something more than just cannon fodder droids!\n",

Absolutely, and unequivocally.There are no disappointments in this calendar, there haven't been any disappointments in the past seven calendars we've had over the years.

I found there wasn't quite enough for what I wanted but in terms of the quality of the item, it was excellent, just that my particular project needed slightly moreUPDATE: A year on and I'm still impressed with these - the initial projects were to fill glass containers to look like an ocean and then place potpourri on top for a bathroom decoration - a year on and the colours were still vibrant, plus, despite the humidity of the bathroom, the sand remained fine\n",

When you open the door for each day, you'll find a picture of what the pieces inside can build. If for some reason you've lost the box or it's been damaged, you can download a PDF file below.

Honestly!!! I bought this with the intention of giving it to my son. And I did - eventually. It arrived at work, I opened it and then I accidentally opened the box and opened day 1. At this point, I just couldn't do it and ended up keeping it for the month of December.It ended up being a good work reward for my team - whom ever had done a good job got the pleasure of opening the next window and assembling the toy. It was great fun and I'll definitely be buying another one this year.\n",
